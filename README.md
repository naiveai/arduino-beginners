# Arduino Beginners Workshop

The [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) is a simple-to-use, extensible
microcontroller board. Our workshop aims to build logical thinking skills,
an understanding of the basic structure of programs, and most importantly
of all, a sense of excitement in the possibilties inherent to programming;
all through the Arduino.

The structure of our course, per session, is as follows:

1. Introduction and setup, basic concepts, the first program, and idea generation
2. Sensors as inputs, combining inputs and outputs in complex ways, functions
3. Control flow with if statements, loops, and more complicated examples
4. Movement with motors, and building a simple robot
