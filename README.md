# Arduino Beginners Workshop
The [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) is a small computer (more precisely,
a microcontroller board) that makes it very easy for users to make electronic things.
It has two parts: a circuit board and a program that tells the circuit board what to do. 
The program's written in a *real* programming language (not a heavily simplified
facsimilie like Scratch) which is both easy to learn and extremely powerful.
Arduinos can be used to control lights, make things move using motors, sense light,
particles and gases in the environment and even to build robots!

Our workshop aims to build logical thinking skills, an understanding of the basic
structure of programs, and most importantly of all, a sense of excitement
in the possibilities inherent to programming; all through the Arduino.

# Why should kids learn with Arduinos?
Arduinos are tools that help to raise curiosity and innovative spirit.
Technology is a crucial part of our everday lives, but most people don't know
the amazing things that happen behind the scenes. You wouldn't let your kid drive
without at least a little knowledge of how a car works, so don't do it with computers!

Arduinos are the learner's permits of the programming world, a gateway to seeing and
truly understanding everything that happens on the electron level.

Arduinos make kids wonder about how and why things work the way they work.
In our experience, it gives many the drive to solve interesting problems,
or sometimes just tinker and experiment for the sheer joy of it all!

Here are some of the reasons we encourage kids to play around with Arduino and build some projects,
regardless of whether or not they want to program in their future:
- It's fun
- It's easy and cheap
- It develops creative problem solving skills
- You can build both useful things, and the wackiest things you can dream of
- Overall, it helps to instill the attitude: "Be a ***Maker***, Not Just a *User*"

# Are they old enough for this?
There is no set age, it all depends on your kid and what they feel they're ready for.
The most important thing, as cliche as it sounds, is a sense of curiosity and openness.

On an average, 10 years old is where a kid would be able to fully understand the
concepts we present and build interesting things. However, with parental help and
guidance, much younger kids have been known to pick them up quickly!

# What can kids build?
The only limit is their imagination! Fun things kids can build include:
- Simple blinking lights
- Mini Piano
- "Intruder alert" systems
- Physical games "buzz wire", LED Dice
- Auto watering systems
- Air quality detection
- Temperature sensors
- Line following and obstacle avoiding robots
- Robotic arms

And it serves as the perfect introduction to programming in general, from
which kids can move to developing websites, applications, and more, depending
on their interests.

# Workshop Structure
The structure of our workshop, per session, is as follows:
1. Introduction and setup, basic concepts, the first program, and idea generation
2. Sensors as inputs, combining inputs and outputs in complex ways, functions
3. Control flow with if statements, loops, and more complicated examples
4. Movement with motors, and building a simple robot

# Who we are
We have conducted many private workshops for school students in India,
as well as a workshop in collaboration with IISER for collge students.
We've participated in events ranging from NASSCOM, Google Code-in,
CodeDay and many more.

# What you'll need to bring

- A laptop with any OS, but a modern version of Windows is easiest
- The charger for it
- A can-do attitude!

The Arduino board and the required electronic components
will be provided for use during the workshop.

# Fees
The workshop will span over 4 weekends (a session per weekend)
with each session being about 2 hours long.

The fee for the workshop is $80 (total for all 4 sessions).
